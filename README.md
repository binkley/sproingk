## Other features

* Latest JUnit 5
* Access logging ala CLF style
* Quieter tests and runtime (always in progress!)

## Things to think about

* Update Spring Boot to 1.5 RC when Sleuth catches up
* Logging is still to noisy during build and tests
* Some "bleeding edge" difficulties, e.g., Spring REST docs + Spring 5 beta
* Replace nested tests with scenario tests (see [Introduce first-class support for scenario tests #48](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/48), pending [5.0 M5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/milestone/8) drop of JUnit)
